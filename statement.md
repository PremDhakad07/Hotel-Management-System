# Project Statement for Hotel Management System (HMS)

## Problem Statement
Current manual procedures for managing room inventory, reservations, and guest billing in hotels are inefficient, slow, and highly susceptible to errors such as double-booking or calculation mistakes. This lack of centralized data management negatively impacts both operational efficiency and guest satisfaction.

## Scope of the Project
The project focuses on developing a **core operational system** that handles internal hotel administration tasks.

**In Scope:**
* Implementation of the three primary functional modules: Room Management, Reservation Tracking, and Automated Billing.
* Application of fundamental Java OOP concepts and data structures.
* Basic console-based input/output and simple error handling.

**Out of Scope (Future Work):**
* Database persistence (currently uses in-memory storage).
* Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* Advanced reporting (daily/monthly revenue reports).
* External payment gateway integration.

## Target Users
1.  **Hotel Administrative Staff (Admin):** Users responsible for system maintenance and viewing reports.
2.  **Hotel Front Desk Staff (Customer Service):** Primary users responsible for day-to-day operations, including booking, check-in, and check-out.

## High-Level Features
* **Room Inventory:** Track status of all rooms in real-time.
* **Reservation:** Create, manage, and track active reservations.
* **Guest Handling:** Record essential guest details.
* **Invoice Generation:** Calculate room charges (based on price and duration) plus tax to produce a final bill.
